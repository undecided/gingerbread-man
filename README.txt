Gf: So, can you make a computer do anything?
Me: Given an infinite amount of time, [and the right hardware], yeah
Gf: So can you program a dancing gingerbread man?


Since no man dare question the craziness found in the female mind, I simply did as I was told.

The first installmant is more of a dancing stick figure (appearing roughly 10mins after the
above conversation) The lady approves, but is not entirely satisfied, but what could I do? My
lunchbreak was up...

The next phase will be to write a Shoes version. Maybe.


Licence? What licence? This code is released under the FMDIDGAD Licence (although who Frankly is,
I don't know - I've never actually seen that film.) War and Tea: I will happily repay the amount that
I charged you for this software provided this code has be forensically proven by a government CSI dept
to have been the sole cause of your computer exploding, your house being razed to the ground with your
charred cat/dog remains inside, and that this code engineered toxic fumes destroying your entire street.
For anything less, including lost time, money, limbs or consciousness, no warranty.   Enjoy!





What? You need usage instructions too? Shall I install it for you too? Personally scrub your ram
afterwards? Sit behind you humming "Did you know the muffin man"? Yeesh... Install a linux distro,
install ruby, open a console or tty and type "ruby dance.rb" from within the folder with the
dance.rb file in. Then watch the pretty stick figure, and press ctrl-c when you get bored.


Note: You know you're doing something wrong when your readme.txt file takes longer to write than
the software it describes. That, or you know you're writing in ruby. God bless ruby.
